# Root the (Ballot) Box

Course resources for the SIGCSE '24 poster, "[Root the (Ballot) Box: Designing Security Engineering Courses with E-Voting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626253.3635518)".

- `Description.md`: The project description from the original deployment of this course.
- `etovucca/`: The starter code for the project. The code was designed to run on the [SEED Labs 16.04 VM](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html), but should work on any environment with minimal tweaks.
